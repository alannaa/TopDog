# TopDog

A Java Android app where users can track their dog walks, interact with other dog owners in the area, and send "pats" (likes) to other dogs on the app

Project highlights:
<ul>
  <li>Pair programmed in group of 5 graduate developers</li>
  <li>Collaborated on design of main features, including the walk tracker, leaderboard, user stats page, and profile</li>
  <li>Worked with google API and GPS services to implement walk tracking features</li>
  <li>My primary contributions were around the back end:
    <ul>
      <li>configuring the structure of user data as represented in POJO</li>
      <li>implementing log in and sign up features to create/store new users</li>
      <li>performing thread management</li>
      <li>implementing utility classes to put and fetch user data off the main thread using Java ExecutiveService and Future< T > objects</li>
      <li>enhancing performance where I saw fit</li>
      <li>managing deserialization of information from the database into User object</li>
      <li>implementing menu navigation and log out functionality </li>
      <li>and assisting in debugging and code cleaning process consistently throughout 1 month duration of the project, prioritizing readability of code and reduction of time and space complexity to optimize within the confines of mobile hardware. </li>
    </ul></li>
