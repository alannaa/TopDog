An android app (java) where users can track the walks they go on with their dog, interact with other dog owners in the area, and send "pats" (likes) to other dogs on the app

Project highlights:
<ul>
  <li>Pair programmed in group of 5 graduate developers</li>
  <li>Collaborated on design of main features, including the walk tracker, leaderboard, user stats page, and profile</li>
  <li>Worked with google API and GPS services to implement walk tracking features</li>
  <li>My primary role was around the back end:
    <ul>
      <li>configuring the structure of user data as represented in POJO</li>
      <li>implementing log in and sign up features to create/store new users</li>
      <li>performing thread management</li>
      <li>implementing utility classes to put and fetch user data off the main thread using Java ExecutiveService and Future< T > objects</li>
      <li>enhancing performance where I saw fit</li>
      <li>managing deserialization of information from the database into User object</li>
      <li>implementing menu navigation and log outfunctionality </li>
      <li>and assisting in debugging and code cleaning process consistently throughout 1 month duration of the project, prioritizing readability of code and reduction of time and space complexity to optimize within the confines of mobile hardware. </li>
    </ul>
